# Under the Hood - JavaScript

When we code an Angular project, it looks like we are just coding in TypeScript.  But TypeScript is JavaScript with additional rules so that we can understand it easily and write cleaner code.  Understand of JavaScript is a major and essential skill to develop a great application.

A fundamental understanding of JavaScript beside knowing the syntax (in ES5, ES6, and so onâ€¦) is to know Object, and Function.  In addition, a clear under standing of module would definitely help.
